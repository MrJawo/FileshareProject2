# FileshareProject2

Fileshare is a simple file transfer program where the client can download files from the server.
When you start the client you will be asked to create an account.
The account credentials you create will then be saved in the server and aloud you to log in.
As long as the server is running you can create multiple client accounts and download files simultaneously.
The files are then saved in the clients download folder.
First start the server.py located in the first folder. Then start client.py located in the clienDirectory folder.
