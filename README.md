# FileshareProject2

Fileshare is a simple file transfer program where the client can download files from the server.
When you start the client app you will be asked to create an account.
The account credentials you created is then saved in the server app and alouds you to log in.
As long as the server is running you can create multiple client accounts and download files simultaneously.
The files are then saved in the clients download folder.
